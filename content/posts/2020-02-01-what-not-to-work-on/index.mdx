Knowing what _not_ to work on is as hard as knowing what you _should_ work on.

Tim Ferriss has a (somewhat outdated) [list](https://tim.blog/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/) written back in 2007.

> “Not-to-do” lists are often more effective than to-do lists for upgrading performance.

Allison Rimm wrote about this in [an article](https://hbr.org/2018/03/taming-the-epic-to-do-list) in Harvard Business Review.

She maintains three lists of tasks:

1. are important, non-time-sensitive
2. need to be completed today
3. aren't worth the time

Any item thats on list number three Allison intentionally skips.

## "Not-to-do" list for building products

Most individual builders have rules about products they won't build. Some have rules about avoiding products with long sales cycles, others have rules about avoiding business-to-consumer (B2C) products.

Below are a few points from makers about what not to build.

### The main thing

Justin Jackson of TransistorFM argues that you should try to be ["the main thing"](https://justinjackson.ca/the-main-thing) or "the entree".

<div style="background-color: #fafafa;">

</div>

Most people order the entree when they go out to dinner and it's often where restaurants make most of their profit.

In the product world, this translates to:

- generally avoid addons
- don't niche-down too much
- provide the bulk of the value

The counter-intuitive point here is that sometimes that means taking on more scope, building a bigger project, and writing more code. It's advice that runs against most of the "start small" and "niche down" logic.

It's all about analyzing the value chain of the market you serve:

<div style="background-color: #fafafa;">

</div>

I highly recommend reading all of Justin's post [here](https://justinjackson.ca/the-main-thing?ref=developerspin.com).

#### Takeaways

- Don't build an appetizer or dessert (unless the market is large)
- Pick a market with momentum
- Pick parts of the value chain that are good for indie makers

### The market you're in

Sahil Lavingia took Gumroad from a weekend project to a venture-backed startup. The growth rate wasn't enough to raise the next round. Check out his journey below:

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-theme="dark">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
      (Gumroad is growing faster now than it was back then)

  </blockquote>

Similar to Justin's advice above, the market your in matters.

### Examples 
If you're building ecommerce software: Good news - ecommerce is growing.

Making podcasting tools or services? Interest is at an all time high and continues to grow.

#### Takeaways
- pick a market that's growing
- don't assume you will grow faster than the market
- not all business models require venture capital

## Quicker Questions

Right now, I'm building a side project that doesn't really follow these guidelines.

When considering HR software, question and presentation software is somewhat ancillary.

Generally, most of the HR software budget will be spent on payroll related items.

Quicker Questions in its current state is not a useful addon to a growing market.

Sli.do, the winner in the space, has seen more and more competition recently. Google even unveiled a tool to do Q&A inside of Google Slides.

Companies change software like this infrequently, meaning growth in this market is heavily tied to the growth of new companies.
