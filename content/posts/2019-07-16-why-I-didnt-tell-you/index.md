In junior high, I was pantsed at the Red Willow county fair – on a “date” nonetheless. Given the fact I was 14, I thought my dating life was over.

It felt a lot like how I’m feeling right now – anxious and exposed.

So instead of letting someone else pants me, I’m just going to do it myself.

I have cancer. I’m not going to hide it. It’s tough. I’ve had testicular cancer since July of last year. It’s been really hard, but it’s survivable.

I told a few people immediately, but I still haven’t told many who are very important to me. Why?

**Because talking about it makes it real.**
You know how sometimes you ignore the thing you need to do, hoping it will magically disappear? Same.

**Because I don’t want your pity.**
I pride myself on hard work, earning things fair and square, and doing things the right way. I don’t want special treatment.

**Because I don’t want every conversation we have to be about my disease.**
I like debating politics, talking about baseball, and catching up on the latest Bachelorette gossip. I didn’t want every conversation to “cancer this, cancer that.”

**Because hard conversations are just that, hard.**
I cry like a baby when I talk to my mom about this stuff. Life is hard sometimes. I really wanted to appear strong throughout all of this. The more hard conversations I have, the higher the chance of me looking like a big baby in public.

**Because I want my work to stand for itself.**
I guess I already talked about this a bit, but I really want to drive home the fact that I don’t feel like I deserve any preferential treatment.

**Because I thought I could beat it.**
I thought I’d look back at this time frame five years from now and go, “man, I beat this thing”. In that case, was it worth creating a lot of fear and drama for those I care about?

**So, why tell you now?**

It turns out cancer isn’t something you beat, it’s something you learn to live with.

My recent blood work shows my [tumor markers](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html) are back up in the “we need to check this out” range. This week I’ll be doing more blood-work, CT and MRI scans, and nervously Googling all the scientific studies I can find on testicular cancer.

I believe in honesty, openness, and transparency. After a year of skipping out early for doctor's appointments, being vague with my team, and wincing every time I hear the word "cancer", I've decided it's time to let people in.

So, please reach out to me and let’s talk about this whole “cancer” thing. Let’s chat about it a few times until you’re out of questions and a little less scared. If you scroll to the bottom of this page, you can find my social media accounts. This website even has a [contact page](/contact).

But then comes the important part — **getting back to normal.** Talk to me about baseball, random tech topics, news, your favorite podcast, or how shitty your day at work was.

Yes, I have a pretty serious disease and lost one testicle, but I’m not going to lose my sense of humor, relationships, or love that I have for all the amazing people in my life.

Love y’all.

_P.S. - A little advice about not getting pantsed: belts are your friends._

_7/20/20 Update:_ Wow, I can't believe it's been a year since I wrote this article.

Two quick notes:

One, I'm doing great – no need to worry about my health 🙂

Two, I wish I would have told people sooner. Going through hard things is a lot easier with the support of the people you love and care about.
