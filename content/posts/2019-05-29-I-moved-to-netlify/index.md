title: I Moved to Netlify
author: Drew Bredvick
excerpt: >-
  Netlify is a super simple way to build and host JAMstack websites. Moving my site over was about a two hour project and was a breeze. TLDR; switch to Netlify.

## The hype is real

I read all over Twitter that I should switch to Netlify for my JAMstack blog website. People said it was easy to develop, that there were great features for building complex web apps, and that it was affordable. All of this sounded awesome, but I had my doubts. I've heard about all of the sturggles people have had debugging magic serverless functions like [Netlify offers](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/).

Then I heard about the `dev`. I'll let the product page speak for itself:

> [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) - Run our entire platform right on your laptop. Preview it all - site generation, functions, and edge logic. <cite>Netlify</cite>

The `dev` tool seemed very well recieved by the developer community on Twitter, which shamelessly was enough to convince me to test it out.

## Where are some of your older posts?

I will still keep around the git repo of my old posts, but I didn't feel like migrating them. There are two reasons for this:

1. I didn't want to do the extra work to migrate it all
2. This gives me a fresh start to be more consistent with documenting my work

It feels good to have people forget about those month long gaps in my post history.

## How often are you going to post now?

I am going to post at least once a week. Think of this as a trial period. If it feels right I'll keep it. If not, I'll speed up/slow down.
